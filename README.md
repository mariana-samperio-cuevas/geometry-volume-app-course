# geometry-volume-app-course
Simulate a simple geometry volume calculator in Python.

This project includes functions to calculate the volume of basic geometric shapes such as boxes, cones, cylinders, and spheres, along with automated tests to verify their correct behaviour.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a main geometry package and a test file. The geometry directory has individual Python modules for each shape, each with a function to calculate volume. The tests directory contains pytest scripts that validate these functions. 



## How to Run main.py

From the project root directory, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```



## How to Run Tests

To run automated tests, execute:

```
pytest
```
